    <p>Insert some witty caption about property management here</p

    <!-- Paragraph section -->
    <section class="single-col-left">
           <p>Alameda County is one of the most diverse counties in the East Bay. From Oakland to Livermore, Alameda County is lush with opportunity when it comes to the rental market. While the cities closer to San Francisco and Oakland offer city living, if you head east towards Livermore, you find wineries, ranches and more rural communities. Year over year, rental rates have increased, yet it continues to be one of the more affordable counties in the area. It is a great place for families and young professionals looking to be close to the city, but with easy access to other parts of California, Nevada, and more. </p>
           <p>Ziprent specializes in matching the best tenants with the right properties.
